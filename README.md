# GPR Modeling and Processing

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and notebooks for **simulating, processing, and analyzing Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data**. The project combines basic GPR forward modeling with common processing steps (filtering, gain, background removal) and exploratory analysis tools such as migration and hyperbola fitting.

This codebase is **research-oriented and exploratory** rather than a polished software package.
